We will show you ads called\u00a0sponsored content\u00a0which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as \u201cad\u201d or \u201csponsored\u201d). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services,\u00a0that action\u00a0may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. Ad Choices We adhere to\u00a0self-regulatory principles\u00a0for interest-based advertising and participate in industry\u00a0opt-outs\u00a0from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also\u00a0opt-out\u00a0specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. For Visitors, the setting is\u00a0here. Info to Ad Providers We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so. 2.5 Marketing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe promote our Services to you and others.\n\n \n\n\n\nIn addition to advertising our Services, we use Members\u2019 data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. 2.6 Developing Services and Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe develop our Services and conduct research", "source": "https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy"}

How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.\n\n \n\n\n\nProfile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your\u00a0settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our\u00a0Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their\u00a0usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.  When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your\u00a0settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a\u00a0group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your\u00a0settings. Any information you share through companies\u2019 or other organizations\u2019 pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that \u201cpage owner\u201d as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your\u00a0settings\u00a0where applicable. Subject to your\u00a0settings, we let a Member know when you view their profile. When you like or re-share or comment on another\u2019s content (including ads), others will be able to view these \u201csocial actions\u201d and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).", "source": "https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy"}
{"text": "Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.\n\n \n\n\n\nEnterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of\u00a0Sales Navigator\u00a0will be asked to share their \u201csocial selling index\u201d, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your\u00a0settings, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.\n\n \n\n\n\nSome Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others\u2019 Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may link your account with others\u2019 services so that they can look up your contacts\u2019 profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.\n\n \n\n\n\nSubject to your\u00a0settings, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may\u00a0revoke\u00a0the link with such accounts. Subject to your\u00a0settings, excerpts from your\u00a0profile\u00a0will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging,\u00a0social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). \u201cOld\u201d profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile. 3.4 Related Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.\n\n \n\n\n\nWe will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may use others to help us with our Services.\n\n \n\n\n\nWe use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. 3.6 Legal Disclosures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may need to share your data when we believe it\u2019s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.", "source": "https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy"}

We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our\u00a0Data Request Guidelines\u00a0and\u00a0Transparency Report. 3.7 Change in Control or Sale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\n \n\n\n\nWe can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.\n\n \n\n\n\nWe generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. 4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.", "source": "https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy"}

We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below. We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have\u00a0restricted\u00a0your account for breach of our\u00a0Professional Community Policies), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to \"unsubscribe\" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Other Important Information 5.1.

For example, if you get a LinkedIn connection request, we track whether you have acted on it and will send you reminders. We also use\u00a0automatic scanning\u00a0technology on messages to support and protect our site. For example, we use this technology to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or\u00a0Professional Community Policies\u00a0from our Services. 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.\n\n \n\n\n\nOthers buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni.

Subject to your and their\u00a0settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others\u2019 connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other\u00a0nearby\u00a0Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event). It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can\u00a0choose\u00a0whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections. Visitors have\u00a0choices\u00a0about how we use their data. Stay Informed Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your\u00a0settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a\u00a0social action, used a feature, made new connections or were\u00a0mentioned in the news. Career Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a\u00a0specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are\u00a0interested\u00a0in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services. Productivity Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your\u00a0settings\u00a0allow, we scan messages to provide \u201cbots\u201d or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.\u00a0Learn more. 2.2 Premium Services", "source": "https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=content_footer-privacy-policy"}

We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing other ads.\n\n \n\n\n\nWe target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of\u00a0partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:  Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers; Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry); Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,\u00a0groups\u00a0participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3; Information from advertising partners, vendors and\u00a0publishers\u00a0; and Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).  We will show you ads called\u00a0sponsored content\u00a0which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as \u201cad\u201d or \u201csponsored\u201d). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services,\u00a0that action\u00a0may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. Ad Choices We adhere to\u00a0self-regulatory principles\u00a0for interest-based advertising and participate in industry\u00a0opt-outs\u00a0from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also\u00a0opt-out\u00a0specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. For Visitors, the setting is\u00a0here. Info to Ad Providers We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so. 2.5 Marketing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe promote our Services to you and others.\n\n \n\n\n\nIn addition to advertising our Services, we use Members\u2019 data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. 2.6 Developing Services and Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe develop our Services and conduct research", "source": "https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=content_footer-privacy-policy"}

In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under\u00a0controls\u00a0that are designed to protect your privacy.

Subject to your\u00a0settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our\u00a0Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their\u00a0usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.  When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your\u00a0settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a\u00a0group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your\u00a0settings. Any information you share through companies\u2019 or other organizations\u2019 pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that \u201cpage owner\u201d as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your\u00a0settings\u00a0where applicable. Subject to your\u00a0settings, we let a Member know when you view their profile. When you like or re-share or comment on another\u2019s content (including ads), others will be able to view these \u201csocial actions\u201d and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).", "source": "https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=content_footer-privacy-policy"}
{"text": "Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.\n\n \n\n\n\nEnterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of\u00a0Sales Navigator\u00a0will be asked to share their \u201csocial selling index\u201d, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your\u00a0settings, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.\n\n \n\n\n\nSome Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others\u2019 Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may link your account with others\u2019 services so that they can look up your contacts\u2019 profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.\n\n \n\n\n\nSubject to your\u00a0settings, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may\u00a0revoke\u00a0the link with such accounts. Subject to your\u00a0settings, excerpts from your\u00a0profile\u00a0will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging,\u00a0social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). \u201cOld\u201d profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile. 3.4 Related Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.\n\n \n\n\n\nWe will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services.

They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. 3.6 Legal Disclosures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may need to share your data when we believe it\u2019s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.", "source": "https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=content_footer-privacy-policy"}

We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.
